## PROJECT OVERVIEW
### PROBLEM OR ISSUE 
Our goal for this project is to improve the efficiency of a newspaper agency by analyzing the popularity of historical news article data from their website.
### PURPOSE OF PROJECT
Higher efficiency will also result in higher revenues for a newspaper agency through ad revenues resulting from higher click rates. 
### BUSINESS CASE
The analysis we perform through the historical data can be purchased by newspaper agencies to improve the quality of their product and services. They can also use our analyzed data to evaluate the performances of their writers.
### GOALS / METRICS
The project goal is to improve the ad revenues and lower the costs spent on lower quality articles by monitoring the topics of the articles, the number of Facebook activities per articles, and the common terms in each topic.
### EXPECTED DELIVERABLES
Implementation of a software that is capable of extracting news articles, more specifically the common terms of the most popular news, authors of the articles, and the number of Facebook activities.

## PROJECT SCOPE
### WITHIN SCOPE
In our project, we only use the historical news article data of one specific news agency website (Telex). The analyzed data includes the Facebook activities of the most popular articles on the website.
### OUTSIDE OF SCOPE
Our project does not include the analysis of articles from any other news sites. On Telex, the less popular articles don’t have a Facebook activity counter, therefore we will not include them in our only analysis.
